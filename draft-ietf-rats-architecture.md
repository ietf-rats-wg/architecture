--- abstract

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that
one entity (a Relying Party) requires evidence about a remote peer to assess the peer's
trustworthiness, and a way to appraise such evidence. The evidence is typically a set of claims
about its software and hardware platform. This document describes an architecture for such
remote attestation procedures (RATS).

# Introduction

    <more text to be added here>

Remote Attestation, as used in this document, is a process by
which one entity (the "Attester") provides evidence about its identity and
state to another remote entity (the "Relying Party"), which then assesses the
Attester's trustworthiness for the Relying Party's own purposes.

# Terminology {#terminology}

This document uses the following terms:

* Appraisal Policy for Evidence: A set of rules that direct how a Verifier evaluates the validity of information about an Attester.      Compare /security policy/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Appraisal Policy for Attestation Result: A set of rules that direct how a Relying Party uses the evaluation results about an Attester generated by the Verifiers. Compare /security policy/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Attestation Result: The evaluation results generated by a Verifier, typically including information about an Attester, where the Verifier vouches for the validity of the results.

* Attester: An entity whose attributes must be evaluated in order to determine whether the entity is considered trustworthy, such as when deciding whether the entity is authorized to perform some operation.

* Endorsement: A secure statement that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of an Attester's signing capability.

* Endorser: An entity that creates Endorsements that can be used to help evaluate trustworthiness of Attesters.

* Evidence: A set of information about an Attester that is to be evaluated by a Verifier.

* Relying Party: An entity that depends on the validity of information about another entity, typically for purposes of authorization.  Compare /relying party/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Relying Party Owner: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results in a Relying Party.

* Verifier: An entity that evaluates the validity of Evidence about an Attester.

* Verifier Owner: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Evidence in a Verifier.

# Reference Use Cases {#referenceusecases}

# Architectural Overview

{{dataflow}} depicts the data that flows between different roles, independent of protocol or use case.

{:dataflow: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ WHOLEFLOW
{::include dataflow.txt}

{:dataflow #dataflow title="Conceptual Data Flow"}

An Attester creates Evidence that is conveyed to a Verifier.

The Verifier uses the Evidence, and any Endorsements from Endorsers,
by applying an Evidence Appraisal Policy to assess the trustworthiness of the Attester,
and generates Attestation Results for use by Relying Parties.  The Evidence Appraisal Policy
might be obtained from an Endorser along with the Endorsements, or might be obtained
via some other mechanism such as being configured in the Verifier by an administrator.

The Relying Party uses Attestation Results by applying its own
Appraisal Policy to make application-specific decisions such as authorization decisions.
The Attestation Result Appraisal Policy might, for example, be configured in the Relying Party 
by an administrator.

# Topological Models {#overview}

There are multiple possible models for communication between an Attester,
a Verifier, and a Relying Party.  This section includes some reference models,
but this is not intended to be a restrictive list, and other variations may exist.

## Passport Model

In this model, an Attester sends Evidence to a Verifier, which compares
the Evidence against its Appraisal Policy.  The Verifier then gives back
an Attestation Result.  If the Attestation Result was a successful one,
the Attester can then present the Attestation Result to a Relying Party,
which then compares the Attestation Result against its own Appraisal Policy.

Since the resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party
includes an Attestation Result, in this model the details of that protocol
constrain the serialization format of the Attestation Result. The
format of the Evidence on the other hand is only constrained by the
Attester-Verifier attestation protocol.

{: #passport title="Passport Model"}

The passport model is so named because of its resemblance to how nations issue
passports to their citizens. The nature of the Evidence that an individual needs
to provide to its local authority is specific to the country involved. The citizen
retains control of the resulting passport document and presents it to other entities
when it needs to assert a citizenship or identity claim, such as an airport immigration
desk. The passport is considered sufficient because it vouches for the citizenship and
identity claims, and it is issued by a trusted authority. Thus, in this immigration
desk analogy, the passport issuing agency is a Verifier, the passport is an Attestation
Result, and the immigration desk is a Relying Party.

## Background-Check Model

In this model, an Attester sends Evidence to a Relying Party, which simply
passes it on to a Verifier.  The Verifier then compares the Evidence against
its Appraisal Policy, and returns an Attestation Result to the Relying Party.
The Relying Party then compares the Attestation Result against its own security
policy.

The resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party
includes Evidence rather than an Attestation Result, but that Evidence is 
not processed by the Relying Party.  Since the Evidence is merely forwarded
on to a trusted Verifier, any serialization format can be used
for Evidence because the Relying Party does not need a parser for it.
The only requirement is that the Evidence can be *encapsulated in* the format
required by the resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party.

However, like in the Passport model, an Attestation Result is still consumed by the
Relying Party and so the serialization format of the Attestation Result is still
important.  If the Relying Party is a constrained node whose purpose is to serve
a given type resource using a standard resource access protocol, it already needs
the parser(s) required by that existing protocol.  Hence, the ability to let the
Relying Party obtain an Attestation Result in the same serialization format allows
minimizing the code footprint and attack surface area of the Relying Party, especially
if the Relying Party is a constrained node.

{: #backgroundcheck title="Background-Check Model"}

The background-check model is so named because of the resemblance of how employers and volunteer
organizations perform background checks. When a prospective employee provides claims about
education or previous experience, the employer will contact the respective institutions or
former employers to validate the claim. Volunteer organizations often perform police background
checks on volunteers in order to determine the volunteer's trustworthiness.
Thus, in this analogy, a prospective volunteer is an Attester, the organization is the Relying Party,
and a former employer or government agency that issues a report is a Verifier.

## Combinations

One variation of the background-check model is where the Relying Party
and the Verifier on the same machine, and so there is no need for a protocol between the two.

It is also worth pointing out that the choice of model is generally up to the Relying Party,
and the same device may need to attest to different Relying Parties for different use cases
(e.g., a network infrastructure device to gain access to the network, and then a
server holding confidential data to get access to that data).  As such, both models may
simultaneously be in use by the same device.

{{combination}} shows another example of a combination where Relying Party 1 uses the 
passport model, whereas Relying Party 2 uses an extension of the background-check model.
Specifically, in addition to the basic functionality shown in {{backgroundcheck}}, Relying Party 2 
actually provides the Attestation Result back to the Attester, allowing the Attester to
use it with other Relying Parties.  This is the model that the Trusted Application Manager
plans to support in the TEEP architecture {{?I-D.ietf-teep-architecture}}.

# Two Types of Environments

An Attester consists of at least one Attesting Environment and Attested Environment.
In some implementations, the Attesting and Attested Environments might be combined.
Other implementations might have multiple Attesting and Attested Environments.

    <this section can include Two Types of Environments content from draft-birkholz-rats-architecture
    but can we find a better name? also this could be a subsection of something else?>

# Trust Model

The scope of this document is scenarios for which a Relying Party
trusts a Verifier that can evaluate the trustworthiness of
information about an Attester.  Such trust might come by the Relying
Party trusting the Verifier (or its public key) directly, or might
come by trusting an entity (e.g., a Certificate Authority) that is
in the Verifier's certificate chain.  The Relying Party
might implicitly trust a Verifier (such as in the Verifying Relying
Party combination).  Or, for a stronger level of security, the
Relying Party might require that the Verifier itself provide
information about itself that the Relying Party can use to evaluate
the trustworthiness of the Verifier before accepting its Attestation Results.

In solutions following the background-check model, the Attester is
assumed to trust the Verifier (again, whether directly or indirectly
via a Certificate Authority that it trusts), since the Attester
relies on an Attestation Result it obtains from the Verifier, in
order to access resources.

The Verifier trusts (or more specifically, the Verifier's security
policy is written in a way that configures the Verifier to trust) a
manufacturer, or the manufacturer's hardware, so as to be able to
evaluate the trustworthiness of that manufacturer's devices.  In solutions
with weaker security, a Verifier might be configured to implicitly
trust firmware or even software (e.g., a hypervisor).  That is, it
might evaluate the trustworthiness of an application component, or operating
system component or service, under the assumption that information
provided about it by the lower-layer hypervisor or firmware is true.
A stronger level of security comes when information can be vouched
for by hardware or by ROM code, especially if such hardware is
physically resistant to hardware tampering.  The component that is
implicitly trusted is often referred to as a Root of Trust.

# Privacy Considerations

The conveyance of Evidence and the resulting Attestation Results
reveal a great deal of information about the internal state of a
device.  In many cases, the whole point of the Attestation process is
to provide reliable information about the type of the device and the
firmware/software that the device is running.  This information is
particularly interesting to many attackers. For example, knowing that a device is
running a weak version of firmware provides a way to aim
attacks better.

Protocols that convey Evidence or Attestation Results are responsible for
detailing what kinds of information are disclosed, and to whom they are exposed.

# Security Considerations

Any solution that conveys information used for security purposes, whether
such information is in the form of Evidence, Attestation Results, or
Endorsements, or Appraisal Policy, needs to support end-to-end integrity protection
and replay attack prevention, and often also needs to support additional
security protections.  For example, additional means of authentication,
confidentiality, integrity, replay, denial of service and privacy
protection are needed in many use cases.

To evaluate the security provided by a particular Appraisal Policy, it
is important to understand the strength of the Root of Trust, e.g.,
whether it is mutable software, or firmware that is read-only after
boot, or immutable hardware/ROM.

It is also important that the Appraisal Policy was itself obtained
securely.  As such, if Appraisal Policy in a Relying Party or Verifier
can be configured via a network protocol, the ability to attest to
the health of the client providing the Appraisal Policy needs to be
considered.
