That is, can the Verifier say that an attestation result it generates has an expiration associated?   (Physical passports and drivers licenses for example do have an expiration associated, as do X.509 certificates.)\r\n\r\nOr is the lifetime only implementable by the Relying Party based on other information like a Timestamp in the attestation result and its own appraisal policy for attestation results?\r\n\r\nAnd is there any requirement that a Relying Party and an Attestation Server need roughly synchronized clocks?  (I suspect yes.)\r\n\r\nOffhand, I think that it would be good to allow attestation results to include an expiration timestamp.

The altered behavior has security relevance. Therefore, the trust model should describe the conditions in which acceptance of the message is warranted. For example, the Verifier accepts Endorsements from an Endorser because it believes the Endorser is an authority for asserting claims about how an entity was constructed, manufactured, tested, etc...\r\n\r\nTrust in the opposite direction of the message flow is also relevant but from a privacy context. The Endorser trusts the Verifier to receive Endorsements to use them to satisfy appraisals (and not for other purposes such as marketing or advertising???). Though I don't know if it is appropriate for the arch document to speculate on this. Nevertheless, the last paragraph in this section talks about privacy.

      "body": "Here's some possible text.\r\n\r\nEndorser\r\nThe primary function of an Endorser is to endorse an Attester so that a Verifier can know to trust that Attester. The Endorser does this by creating an Endorsement and conveying it securely to the Verifier. The primary basis for a Verifier trusting an Attester is the Endorsement.\r\n\r\nThere is thus an existential relationship between Attesters and Endorsers.  An Attester with no Endorsement is not worth very much since there is no good basis by which a Verifier can trust it so every Attester needs an Endorser. The Endorser\u2019s primary function is to endorse Attesters so an Endorser doesn\u2019t have anything to do without some Attesters to endorse.\r\n\r\nA Verify cannot do its job without Endorsements. It must have an Endorsement for each Attester from which it received Attestation Evidence. Without this, the Attester is not trusted and there is no basis for trusting the Evidence it produces.\r\n\r\nThere is a trust triangle between the Endorser, Attester and Verifier. The Endorser tells the Verifier that an Attester is trustworthy.\r\n\r\nEndorsement\r\nUltimately an Endorsement must be realized as some input bytes to a Verifier and they must be conveyed securely from the Endorser to the Verifier. RATS architecture does not impose any limit or restriction on the formats of these bytes or the conveyance mechanism.  In practice they are expected to vary quite widely.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the Endorsement will include the key material that is used to verify signatures on the Evidence. Since the Evidence will contain a nonce, this signature verification serves to authenticate the attester. The Endorsement may also contain information about the Attester such as its type, version, manufacturer and such.\r\n\r\nIn one example, the Endorser and the Verifier are the same legal organization, so secure conveyance is entirely an internal issue for the organization. It may consist of one employee copying a set of public keys from computer in the company to another.\r\n\r\nIn another example, the Endorsement may take the form of a PKI hierarchy. The Endorser conveys a root certificate to the Verifier. The Endorser also creates per-attester certificates under that root. Those per-attester certificates are programmed into Attesters. The Attester sends them to the  Verifier attached to the Evidence. There may be several levels of certificates in the PKI hierarchy. The Verifier walks the certificate chain to determine trust.  Note in the case the abstract notion of Endorsement comes to the Verifier in two parts, one in an out-of-band secure conveyance or a root certificate and the other as the signed (self-securing) certificates from the Attester.\r\n\r\nUnendorsed Attesters\r\nThe use of unendorsed Attesters is discouraged because there is no good basis for establishing trust in them. An unendorsed Attester may still have a signing key and produce signed evidence. A Verifier may choose to have some trust in the Evidence they produce by assuming they are trusted on first use (TOFU), building up trust over time after seeing a lot of presumably good attestation evidence, or because it is fed into a machine learning algorithm that correlates to known fraud.  Rats architecture include any facilities, details or designs for this mode of use and explicitly considers it insecure.",

Endorsements are not longer just static documents like X.509 certs and/or COSE/CMS signed blobs. They are anything that conveys the attestation key material into the Verifier or allows Verification of the attester. They must support confidentiality.\r\n\r\n2) Replace the term \u201cEndorsement\u201d with something like \u201cVerifier Input\u201d or \u201cAttester Trust Criteria\u201d in the architecture document as the means by which key material goes into the Verifier.

      "body": "The current Section 4.2 text details a hypothetical example aimed at providing clarity of a presumably more abstract concept. However, the concept (illustrated by figure 2) hasn't been explained.\r\n\r\nSuggested wording:\r\nAttestation involving a layered device involves multiple Attesting Environments that collect claims from multiple Target Environments. Attestation \"layering\" exists when the Target Environment contains an Attesting Environment that collects claims for the next layer Target Environment. Layering forms a cascade of target and attesting environments starting with an anchor Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment A) and ending with a leaf Target Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Target Environment C). The leaf environment isn't expected to encapsulate an Attesting Environment. Any number of layered environments (i.e., Figure 2 - Target Environment B / Attesting Environment B) could exist between the anchor and leaf. A hardware execution environment establishes trust in the anchor Attesting Environment (see Section 4.1). \r\n\r\nA Verifier relies on Endorsements for insight regarding trustworthiness of the anchor Attesting Environment. Verifiers may require Endorsements for all the environments. Each Attesting Environment generates Evidence for its respective Target Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Layered Evidence for B and C). \r\n\r\nLayering of Evidence means the first layer Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment A) integrity protects Evidence B and the next layer Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment B) integrity protects Evidence C.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI stopped short of describing use of keys for integrity protection, whether or not the same or different keys can be used or where the keys are stored / protected. By inference, the attesting environments either have them locally or can use them by keyID or some other way. I also stopped short of describing how the Verifier disambiguates Evidence B from Evidence C or how each evidence instance is attributed to its proper attesting environment. If it is important to describe this then maybe more words are needed?\r\n\r\nI think the remainder of the section could more efficiently describe the BIOS / PC boot use case relying more on the terminology in Figure 2 to describe a mapping from the abstraction in Figure 2 to an example implementation.",

A simple realization of the architecture associates a single role to a single entity; for example, the topological models described in section 5.1 and 5.2 follow this convention. However, entities may host multiple roles as a way to accommodate more sophisticated use cases and deployment scenarios. An entity that both connects to a wide-area network and to a system bus may play both Attester and Verifier roles. As a system bus entity, a Verifier consumes Evidence from other devices connected to the system bus that implement an Attester role. As a wide-area network connected entity, it may implement an Attester role. The entity, as a system bus Verifier, may choose to fully isolate its role as a wide-area network Attester. Alternatively, attestation results might reflect an aggregation of system bus operational state claims in the form of Evidence. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the Composite Device scenario, the lead Attester...\r\n<paste remainder of paragraph from section 4.3>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the introduction section should change \"role composition\" terminology to \"topological models\" as it references Passport.

          "body": "Going back to Laurence\u2019s original request. The observation he is making is that both the Endorser and the Appraisal Policy for Evidence Owner entities can say what is a \u2018reference\u2019 or \u2018known good\u2019 value. Presumably, an Owner entity did some due diligence to ensure the KGV is indeed \u2018good\u2019 given Owners may not have access to source code or other tools that the original vendor has access to. But ultimately, all appraisal decisions are qualified by the Owner\u2019s wishes.\r\n\r\nThere is complexity in ecosystems when a vendor (e.g. BIOS vendor) doesn\u2019t give up ownership of the FW even though the computer is sold to the customer. The PC owner might have a policy that allows the BIOS vendor to supply an Appraisal policy for just the BIOS. The Roles architecture for the BIOS component may differ from the Roles architecture for other components. In this case, the Endorsement and Policy roles may be supplied by the same Entity (i.e. the bios vendor).\r\n\r\nSee more inline below - Nms>\r\n\r\nFrom: ericvoit <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Friday, April 3, 2020 at 5:54 AM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\nHi Eric, Dave,\r\nI'd just add one more restriction to the list... if \"known good values\" means \"if the measured hash in a PCR is exactly this value then we're good\", the domain has to be narrowed to single-threaded well-known software instances, e.g., the components of a BIOS.\r\nNms> Endorsements and KGVs are synonyms AFA the Architecture is concerned. I think some people may interpret that phrase to be specific to FW digest values. But I don\u2019t think of it that way. Any claim can be asserted as being \u201cgood\u201d by the vendor of the asset that the claim applies.\r\nNms> The conversation around TPM PCRs adds a layer of abstraction that can be confusing at times. A PCR is a hash tree. The \u201cEvent Log\u201d is the actual tree that was hashed. The RATS Architecture defines several patterns for how a device might be constructed (e.g. Composite Device, Layered Device,\u2026) These structures can be decomposed into hash trees and integrity protected using a TPM. Or they can be decomposed into other Evidence structures that may included certificates, EAT tokens or CoSWIDs (or something else for that matter). Hopefully, the industry will consolidate around a few possibilities (hence the architecture\u2019s attention to patterns).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complexity of known-good-values comes with asynchronous threads such as IMA in Linux; in that case, the hash in the TPM PCR can only serve as a check on the (perhaps huge) number of individual hashes in the log file, each of which needs its own Known Good Value. Hence the SWID tags.\r\nNms> This is more of a scalability scenario IMO because IMA is trying to track changes in a dynamic environment. While much of the attention for attestation, initially, has been around asset tracking, onboarding and boot scenarios where the dynamics of what can change is greatly restricted.\r\nNms> The overarching goal for Endorsement is for the Verifier to correlate it with Evidence, and vice versa. The dynamics of both need to be comprehended. In the Freshness section of the architecture the focus has been on Evidence dynamics. There is also the concept of Endorsement freshness to consider. The challenge for the architecture is how much attention should be given to this when Endorsement is out of scope for the WG?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm certainly not qualified to say how all this would work in EAT- or TEEP-land...\r\n/guy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuniper Business Use Only\r\nFrom: Eric Voit (evoit) <evoit@cisco.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, April 2, 2020 4:14 PM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>; ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>; Smith, Ned <ned.smith@intel.com>; Guy Fedorkow <gfedorkow@juniper.net>\r\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: RE: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say they are never sufficient.

For example, section 7.2 says \u201cdevices from a given manufacturer have information matching a set of known-good reference values,\u201d and \u201cThus, an Endorsement may be helpful information in authenticating information about a device, but is not necessarily sufficient to authorize access to resources which may need device-specific information such as a public key for the device\u201d\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this is scant and leaves a lot to the reader to figure out or make assumption. The architecture could more clearly capture the idea that Endorsements are \u201creference\u201d claims that are compared with Evidence claims to validate their correctness. It should introduce other common terms such as \u2018known good values\u2019, \u2018reference values\u2019 and \u2018endorsed values\u2019 as roughly synonymous.\r\n\r\nI think it should go further to say that Endorsements can include values that are static (intrinsic) that don\u2019t require attestation, but can be asserted about a class of device, platform, entity and appraised according to an appraisal policy for Evidence (Even though the claims don\u2019t appear in Evidence).\r\n\r\nWhile I think it is possible to interpret the existing wording according to the above understanding, it is also possible to interpret it differently. Therefore, the section should be improved.\r\n\r\nI also think the first sentence (and definition in terminology) are insufficient. While \u201cAn Endorsement is a secure statement that some entity (e.g., a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of the device\u2019s signing capability.\u201d \u2013 is correct, it is insufficient because it is also a statement about the devices Attesting Environment ability to collect claims securely.\r\n\r\nFrom: Laurence Lundblade <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Monday, April 6, 2020 at 3:04 PM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: \"Smith, Ned\" <ned.smith@intel.com>, Comment <comment@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\n\r\n> On Apr 6, 2020, at 12:15 PM, Ned Smith <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> The challenge for the architecture is how much attention should be given to this when Endorsement is out of scope for the WG?\r\n\r\nThe architecture doc should (must?) facilitate a good understanding of attestation end-end for the reader.\r\n\r\nK-g-v seem like a very core concept to attestation.

I believe that the Relying Party may require Evidence from the Verifier to trust it, in fact, this is precisely how the Microsoft Azure Attestation Service (a Verifier) has been designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nNMS> I don\u2019t think it is the intent of the arch doc to say that it expects different entities should use different techniques to establish initial trust. The trust model assumes, however, the various role interactions have pre-requisite trust relationships. It isn\u2019t a goal of the architecture to define how to bootstrap or establish pre-requisite trust relationships. Some suggestions are provided, but maybe it makes sense to discuss it in one part of the document only?\r\n\r\nTopic 2: conceptual dataflow diagram. The conceptual dataflow diagram in the architecture spec does not currently reflect that the Verifier may also be an Attester and then share Evidence with the Endorser, Verifier Owner and Relying Party. Should it be updated? Or have a 2nd more complex diagram?\r\n\r\nNMS> The conceptual model is intended to present a canonical model (one that is simplified) and leave it up to targeted designs to determine how best to apply more complex interactions. Nevertheless, the case for using Attestation as a way to establish pre-requisite trust between the Roles may not be the best example of \u201ccomplex Role interactions\u201d since the assumption/presumption that pre-requisite trust between Roles / entities has already been addressed (somehow). Rather, more interesting / complex interactions might be something like the composite device where a local Verifier appraises some of the Sub-Attesters\u2019 Evidence but not all of it. In this case there is both local and remote Verifiers. The remote Verifier is implementing the Relying Party role to the local Verifier\u2019s Attestation Results. It may be generating its own Attestation Results and combining both sets of Attestation Results for consumption by other Relying Parties. We don\u2019t say the remote Verifier isn\u2019t a Relying Party; rather we say the entity that hosts the remote Verifier may also host a Relying Party role (to the local Verifier).\r\n\r\nThere has been continued discussion about the differences between a role and the entity that implements / hosts the role(s). Often it is convenient to refer to the entity using the Role name, but that becomes confusing if the entity hosts multiple roles. I think the architecture design team is hopeful that drafts will be careful to distinguish the differences as they can draw upon use case context to name entities according to use case intuition rather than by using Role names.\r\n\r\nTopic 3: EAT. If accurate, I'd like to see a clear acknowledgement that the Verifier may need to act as an Attester for the Relying Party since I'd like to then see specifically how the IETF EAT specification covers this circumstance. In other words, for an EAT that represents an AttestationResult, would the Evidence for the Verifier be embedded or discovered? If embedded, how are submods distinguished for the Verifier's Evidence versus the AttestationResult's embedded claims, including nested EAT's?\r\n\r\nNMS> The EAT draft is primarily defining a set of claims. Although, philosophically signed (integrity protected claims) are more correctly referred to as Evidence, Endorsement or Attestation Results (because of who signed them and what Role they were playing when signing them). The architecture thinks (unsigned) claims could be expressions that are suitable as Evidence, Endorsements or Attestation Results. The context of how claims are asserted determines which Role Message term is best.\r\n\r\nI sorta think the example in Topic 3 conflates pre-requisite trust establishment between entities performing RATS Roles with the operational use case of Attesting a pledge device. Recursive application of RATS architecture is possible, as a way to bootstrap a deployment of RATS Roles. But it seems wrong to conflate the recursion to somehow define the Roles differently.\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture/issues/92>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABPMCSH56ORV5YNUXR7OF4LRVEKX5ANCNFSM4NUDAUOQ>.\r\n",

I had pointed this out before when the PR was generated, but the PR was merged without addressing this comment.\r\n2) The section about using timestamps with synchronized clocks was removed and replaced with a section that talks about a different mechanism (handles) that is not in any RFC or WG document.   I believe that such replacement is inappropriate.  If the WG adopts a document that talks about a handle distribution mechanism, then a section can be added.  Or if there is a standard from another org that can be referenced then it's fine to add one in that case too. But I think it should not replace the section discussing the well known technique of synchronized clocks (e.g., using secure NTP, or PTP (IEEE 1588-2002) or whatever other standard mechanism).\r\n3) time(HD) is problematic as phrased since all the other events are times as seen by a single entity, whereas time(HD) does not clearly say whose perspective (i.e., whose clock) it is from... is it the distributor's?  Text is unclear.\r\n4) It talks about nonces in a timestamp section, which I think causes confusion since there's already a separately section about nonces and this section is labeled to be scoped to timestamps.   Addressing #2 might address this naturally, if it uses a different section title.\r\n5) There are some editorial typos, such as capital \"The\" in the middle of a sentence, etc.\r\n6) I have no idea what \"delta(time(HD),time(EG))distribution-interval\" is supposed to mean.   Normally I would expect an equality for any condition to be evaluated, but I have no idea what this check is.\r\n7) time(HD) and time(EG) are according to different clocks (if my guess about point 3 above is right) and so the delta is not directly comparable.  I'm not sure how point 6 accounts for this.\r\n8) The phrase \"A nonce not predictable to an Attester (recentness & uniqueness) is sent to an Attester\" has \"(recentness & uniqueness)\" which doesn't read well (sounds like bad grammar) to me, and is not explained.",

      "body": "Reviewing the trust relationships described in the architecture document got me thinking about sharpening a distinction between device attestation (e.g., EAT for phone) and service authenticity (e.g. HTTPS for a web site):\r\n\r\n**Device Attestation**\r\n\r\n- Focus is on the implementation, the HW and SW\r\n- The legal entity of interest is the device manufacturer\r\n- The claims are about the HW and the SW, not the device owner\r\n- Example: a mobile phone (not its owner/user)\r\n- Example: integrity of a remote device\r\n\r\n**Service Authenticity**\r\n\r\n- Focus is on the provider of the service, not the HW or SW\r\n- The legal entity of interest is the service provider\r\n- There is no equivalent of claims, but if there was they would be about the business or person operating the service\r\n- Example: a web site\r\n- Example: an email provider (IMAP service)\r\n\r\nService providers (e.g., web sites) use whatever HW and SW they want to use. As a user of the service we don\u2019t care what HW and SW they select. We trust the service provider to pick good HW and SW and to configure and operate it correctly. They might change the HW and the SW and as a user we won\u2019t know.  For example we trust Bank of Xxx to operate their banking web site correctly with little concern for their HW. This is why attestation of the HW and SW is not so useful to the user of a service.\r\n\r\nUsers of mobile phones and IoT devices are not trustworthy to pick secure HW and SW. They are not professionals like the people running web sites. There is little accountability against them if they pick bad SW and HW. Therefor we want attestation for these usage scenarios. This is why EAT, FIDO and Android Attestation exist.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the line between device attestation and service authenticity is completely black and white. In some use cases attestation may be bent to provide some service authenticity. But I don\u2019t think it makes sense to add attestation to the millions of web sites out there, add support for it to browsers and make attestation an extra layer of security for web browsing.\r\n\r\nI think it is fine for a service provider to use attestation inside their service to monitor integrity and such of the HW and SW providing the service. But usually that won\u2019t be manifest outside the service. It could be awkward for the user to the service to have to re evaluate the service every time the service provider changes HW.\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at this is from a certification / regulatory view. If the thing you're looking at is a candidate for implementation certification such as Common Criteria, FIPS, FIDO certification, then it probably lines up with device attestation. On the other hand, if the thing your are looking at lines up with regulation (e.g., banking regulation, GDPR,...) and to some degree OWASP, then it probably lines up with service authenticity. \r\n\r\nI think the RATS architecture document should probably have text that describes when attestation is applicable and when it is not, for example saying something like \u201cattestation is not a replacement or augmentation for HTTPS/TLS\"",

And not all\r\n    Verifiers should be seen as equivalently trustworthy.  Additionally, any\r\n    particular Verifier might be able to provide a consistent level of certainty\r\n    in the \"Attestation Results\".  This is because the capabilities of the\r\n    Attesting Environment will vary.   This section does not hint at the varying\r\n    levels of certainty in the \"Attestation Results\" based on the varying\r\n    quality and quantity of available Evidence of different types of Attesters.\r\n    I am not sure if this truism belongs in this section.  Or if this truism\r\n    belongs in the document at all.  But without having this nuance being\r\n    described somewhere, it could leave the perception of a higher level of\r\n    confidence in the Appraisals being from a deployable RATS architecture made\r\n    than might necessarily be warranted.    Note that this issue is also alluded\r\n    to in Section 7.4 and Section 12.  But neither address things like whether\r\n    Attestation Result values should provide a minimum level of confidence\r\n    regardless of the type of Attester being evaluated.\r\n    In the end, I am fine if nothing changes in the document as a result of this\r\n    comment, but I wanted to have the authors consider whether this is worth a\r\n    statement or two.\r\n",

The organization managing such infrastructure needs to ensure that only authorized code and users can control such processes, and that these processes are protected from unauthorized manipulation or other threats. When a protocol operation can affect a component of a critical system, the device attached to the critical equipment requires some assurances depending on the security context, including that: the requester and the triggering sensor have not been compromised, and the requesters and actors act on applicable policies, As such, remote attestation can be used to only accept commands from requesters that are within policy.\"",

There existing text seems to focus on giving advice about the different aspects of what it means to trust different entities that may be performing the various roles in the attestation architecture. Certainly, the verifier is the most complex of all the roles with 4 inputs and one output message. And we have made an architectural decision to put the complexity in the Verifier generally. It seems to do this in a way that makes it clear, the section should be broken into smaller parts. For example, a sub section for each input / output message type. There are some basic sequence of operations too, such as verifying signature, decoding of messages, discovering and assembling all the context needed before appraisal can start. Then there is appraisal processing. What constitutes a match between Evidence claims and Reference Value claims etc. \r\n\r\nBut if the objective of the section is to just talk about what the semantics of 'trust' are, maybe it achieves that goal already. Though it doesn't do a great job of laying out that that is the goal. \r\n",

As an example, if DER-encoded X.509v3 certificates are the only message format used in a protocol, it might become necessary to embed all RATS conceptional messages in the certificates conveyed or even use the same DER-encoding the certificates are represented in.",

This critical point isn't mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is Attesting Environment A is also the Verifier for the evidence from target environment B. There are two roles in the same box, Attester and Verifier. This seems to be implied by the paragraph after Figure 3. The paragraph that starts \"Attesting Environment A... has to ensure the integrity of the boot loader (Target Environment B)\". However, figure 3 only shows a remote Verifier.\r\n\r\nA third possibility is A does ensure integrity of B, but it's not Attestation. It is just typical staged boot that is being described. It is not layered attestation. I think we should distinguish staged boot from local Attestation Verification. It doesn't seem right to claim that all staged boot is local Attestation Verification and thus RATS applies to all staged boot.\r\n\r\nIn the cases where A does locally ensure the integrity of B either via staged boot or a local Verifier, then the remote verifier can actually trust the evidence about C without first evaluating the evidence from B.\r\n\r\nOr, all three of the above could be intended. There is nothing wrong with implementations that do any of these or combinations of them.\r\n\r\nI think the text should decide which of the three it is going after here and be clear about them.",

I think that without a better handle (pun intended) on the target use case audience, it's hard to know if one can really make this work.  Clearly an epoch identity distributor  (which would be... a _historian_?) could sign with an asymmetric key, and for some use cases the authenticator (public key) could be widely distributed, or baked into firmware.\r\n\r\nTo me, the primary security for the identifiers is availability.\r\nI think that the epoch identifier is key to doing the TUDA: if one wants one way attestations coming *out* only of a nuclear power plant, then the freshness has to get in via some broadcast system, I think.

This architecture document does not define any general purpose format for Reference Values or general means for comparison.\" describes the properties of a conceptual message. I've rewritten it below substituting 'conceptual message' to make the statement covering of the other messages.\r\n\"The actual data format and semantics of any conceptual message are specific to Claims and implementations. This architecture document does not define any general purpose format for conceptual messages or general means for comparison.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the \"Appraisal Policies\" section the following:\r\n\"The actual data format and semantics of any Appraisal Policy is implementation specific.\"\r\nis pretty close to describing properties of any conceptual message.\r\nE.g.:\r\n\"The actual data format and semantics of any conceptual message is implementation specific or defined by Internet RFC\".\r\n\r\nI propose moving the slightly modified sentences above to a new section 8 (8.0) to describe what we mean by conceptual message. \r\nMove the remaining text and headings in the arch overview for \"Appraisal Policy\" and \"Reference Values\" to section 8 as new sub heading 8.4 and 8.5 (or some reasonable ordering of the sections).",

The interactions described here do not conform behaviors described in the terminology in Section 4 or the high-level reference architecture of Figure 1.  I'm not sure how to reconcile this discrepancy.  \r\n\r\nMinimally, these discrepancies are:\r\n\r\n-- Figure 5.  Per Section 4, \"Attestation Results\" are not supposed to be consumed by the \"Attester\" and are supposed to come from the Verifier (not the Attester).\r\n````\r\n\r\n````\r\n-- Figure 6, Evidence is being provided from the Attester to the Relying Party.  Relying part is providing evidence to the Verifier.\r\n\r\nAdditional sections in the document, e.g., Section 7.2, make use of this interactions too.\r\n\r\nThe introductory text states that \"[t]he discussion that follows is for illustrative purposes only and does not constrain the interactions between RATS roles to the presented patterns.\"  I don't follow what is being illustrated in the context of RATS.  What is the takeaway for implementers or designers from this section?\r\n\r\n** Section 5.1.\r\nIn this model, an Attester conveys Evidence to a Verifier, which\r\n   compares the Evidence against its appraisal policy.  \r\n\r\nShould the analogy be connected to the RATS architecture by saying the citizen is the Attester and the Evidence is ID (e.g., birth certificate) needed to present to get the passport issued.\r\n\r\n** Section 5.1.  Per the paragraph, \"Since the resource access protocol ...\", I found this text an unexpected level of detail.  No earlier part of the document had previously discussed the existence of a serialization format or resource access protocol, let alone interoperability issues\r\n\r\n** Section 7.1  I got a bit lost in the repeated use of the word trust as a verb, noun and adjective.  It seems like two properties should be described:\r\n-\r\n- (authenticity) Trusting that information came from a expected entity/role\r\n\r\n-- (correctness) Having confidence in the veracity of the information being provided (e.g., the processes used by the verifier to process the evidence or compute ).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend being clearer on what kind of trust is meant.\r\n````",

EAT already inherits the jti/cti claims from RFC 7519/8392 respectively.  There is no specific privacy discussion in those documents regarding these claims.  Moreover, the cti/jti claims can be client-originated (potentially internal to entity) and can certainly be used for extraction of PII by bad actors, while a nonce is expected to be verifier-generated (i.e. external to entity).\r\n\r\nIn short, a privacy discussion should cover all anti-replay mechanisms that are possible with CWT/JWT's, not just the claims introduced in EAT.  In that regards, the EAT document may not be the best place for this discussion.  Nevertheless I have made a first attempt:  see https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/eat/pull/164.",

In most other section, generic interaction of roles, artifacts, their associated topologies, and high level security properties was noted.  This section delves into specific implementation choices.  In particular, is the WG sure that it needs all of the details of Section 10.3.  Even among all of the Section in 10.*, this stands out. It doesn't seem to provide enough detail to be create interoperability but goes beyond simply introducing the concept.\r\n\r\n[Roman's comment on -15] Thanks for the extra paragraph to explain why this section is here.  I will confess that I still don't understand why these details are here and stand by my original comment.  It's much more than I would have expected for an architecture (especially considering the extra material in Section 16/Appendix -- 10 pages/almost 20% of the document is devoted to time issues).  If the WG feels like it needs it, I won't push back.  However, if this is the watermark of the level of detail, let's make sure that there is equal treatment for other security issues too.

Composition is hard and can alter the security assumptions of the individual components and introduce emergent risk.\r\n\r\nI don't think it can be solved generically.  However, we do need cautionary text here.  Perhaps:\r\n\r\nNEW (roughly)\r\n\r\nThe RATS architecture allows for an entity to function in multiple roles (Section 6) and for composite devices (Section 3.3).  Implementers need to evaluate their designs to ensure that the assumed security properties of the individual components and roles still holds despite the lack of separation, and that emergent risk is not introduced.  The specifics of this evaluation will depend on the implementation and use case is out of scope for this document.\r\n",

There is no need to let me know what you\r\ndid with these suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Grammar/style\r\n\r\n#### Section 2.6, paragraph 2\r\n```\r\nuthenticator.

It seems the motivation for limiting multiple results formats is to reduce complexity (security objective). However, if the architecture doesn't have this motivation, then filtering TPM formats seems arbitrary. Possibly, the architecture intends to allow multiple Results formats to accommodate protocol constraints. For example, TLS didn't anticipate exchanging Evidence in a handshake, hence it may be necessary to encode it in the certificate path. ",

My text now is about that the Lead Attester has a Verifier role inside. \r\n\r\nMaybe we can divide the remote attestation for the composite devices into two cases:\r\n1. Lead Attester has no local Verifier role. The Lead Attester just collects the Evidence of other Attesters, then it integrates all these Evidence into one Evidence of the whole composite device (with no or little local processing of the collected Evidence), and it conveys the final Evidence to the Verifier.\r\n2. Lead Attester has a local Verifier role. Then after collecting the Evidence of other attesters, the Lead Attester can verify these Evidence and integrates the verification results into the final Evidence of the whole device. This can help reduce the bandwidth for transporting the Evidence between the device and the Verifier, and also can reduce the load of the Verifier. This may be very helpful when the number of devices is large.",

So the host processor first takes on the role of Verifier to verify the modem whether trustworthy and on the whitelist, and then it takes on the role of Relying Party to consume the Attestation Result.\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph, the role combinations can be arbitrary. And this paragraph just gives one example where the entity takes on the role of Attester and Verifier, to show how role combination works.",

The Verifier needs to be told that the root-of-trust / secure element environment exists. It can happen manually, such as an IT department physically issuing a smart card or smart device with a SE to a user, generating the key pair, update the Verifier to trust the public that was generated. Manual approaches work in IT environments where employees are subject to IT procedures. Manual processes may not scale to Internet ecosystems. Remote attestation is trying to go beyond manual processes by generating keys in devices by manufacturers and issuing machine certs that establish that a key is protected by a secure element. This seems like a basic idea that if it isn't clear might belong in the introduction?",

The roles architecture doesn't elevate Attesting Environment and Target Environment to the same status (not arguing to do that either). There is however time considerations that apply between TE and AE interactions. The security consideration (which may be contrived) is that the target environment may exhibit one set of claims at value creation and a different set at value collection / measurement. This could happen if attack code has control of the TE and presents one set of claims at time of collection then reverts back to the other set (and presumably continues execution with the attacker's claims). I can convince myself that if the AE and TE were secure by design, that the scenario shouldn't happen. However, it is a common mistake that measurement of code is taken before it is loaded, but modified after being loaded, but the collected evidence always reports what was though to be loaded not what is actually loaded. If it is important to capture this common mistake. Maybe it belongs in security considerations?",

              "body": "According to Ned's assumption, here is the case: Verifier -> RP1 -> RP2. The verifier gives a result expiry time in the Attestation Result to RP1. RP2 gives another result expiry to RP2. So RP2 has 2 result expiry times. Maybe Ned wants to emphasize that RP2 has to make a choice between these two times.\r\nBut RP can also have other expiry policies that come from other sources, e.g., the administrator configures an expiry time. I think it's up to the implementation to consider how to make decisions among all the policies. What is important here, however, is that the Attestation Result can contain an \u2018expiry\u2019 claim.",

              "body": "I think you meant \"RP1 gives another result expiry to RP2\". I suppose it isn't clear whether RP1 can supply RX or if it only can supply RR. If RX is only a function of a Verifier then the use case doesn't make sense. If RX can be asserted by RP to other RPs, then that implies RX can be a \"Remediation action\" from a RP; which we said might be OK for TEEP arch to define but is likely out of scope for RATS. I prefer to place limits on \"who can say what\" to limit combinatorics and therefore limits the potential for insecure states. Dave T. seems to be saying that unless there is a use case, it doesn't make sense to define the freshness variable. But even with already defined variables it is possible to find insecure states unless some other constraints are acknowledged. Maybe both perspectives can be held simultaneously? \r\n\r\nEven if we limit RX to Verifier only. An (out-of-scope?) RP1 to RP2 flow could define different RX (RX2) that leaves RP2 in the same undecidability state that Pan Wei points out. But I don't think the arch can prevent the possibility for unsecure states. Nevertheless, I'm still an advocate for specifying which entity is expected to make which freshness claim. Put the burden of proof on the use case to justify when it makes sense for other entities to make the freshness claim. ",

Maybe sticking to a few intuitive examples is best. e.g., verifier + relying party, endorser + verifier and maybe verifier+owner. Combining attester and verifier is problematic because the trust model objective is to separate attester from verifier. ",

The main point of line/paragraph 481 is that an entity can host (combine) multiple roles. When that happens, the role messages between roles on peer entities remains true to the roles architecture. For example, if Verifier and RP are combined. Evidence still flows to Verifier and RP still consumes Appraisal policy for Attestation Results (even though there isn't an Attestation Results flow exposed externally to the entity). ",

It's good to provide a bit of context and clarifying information around freshness, but I don't see the need for a big taxonomical effort :-)\r\n\r\nI think the concepts could be condensed in a couple of paragraphs, like:\r\n```\r\nFreshness has two dimensions: recentness and uniqueness.\r\n\r\nUniqueness is conveyed via a non-repeatable value sourced, for example,\r\nfrom a high quality randomness pool, a \u201cgranular enough\u201d clock, a serial\r\nnumber that doesn\u2019t wrap-around, etc.  In the context of Evidence and\r\nAttestation Results, uniqueness can be encoded into a \"nonce\" attribute.\r\n\r\nRecentness is conveyed via either a relative or absolute timestamp - \r\nassociated with the time of collection of claims by the attester, or the\r\ntime the attestation report is produced \u2014 and an either explicit\r\nor implicit \u201cexpiry\u201d value that determines the threshold between\r\nacceptable (i.e. recent enough) and non-acceptable (i.e., too old)\r\nvalues of the timestamp. It assumes time synchronisation between\r\nproducers and consumers.    In the context of Evidence and Attestation\r\nResults, recentness can be encoded using a \"timestamp\" and \"expiry\"\r\nattributes.\r\n```\r\nor similar.  Cheers!",

If the initiator happens to also have:\r\n1) a clock, and\r\n2) a notion of expiry\r\n\r\nthen some form of _rough_ recentness, i.e., one that:\r\n\r\n1) can't distinguish between creation time and collection time of claims;\r\n2) applies to the whole claims set as opposed to individual claims\r\n\r\ncan be built even _without_ a synchronised clock at the responder.\r\n\r\nIs this what the quoted sentence really means to you?\r\n\r\nIf so, I think we can craft some text together that is short and to the point.\r\n\r\nThat said, and again thanks very much for this further edit pass, I'd be still OK with just dropping this PR altogether.\r\n",

Alternatively, a challenger can simply establish a similar bi-lateral trust relationship by conducting a Challenge/Response handshake here. It is a smaller scoped trust relationship, it is temporary, and the challenger must at least be RESTful in order not to forget that it created the nonce in the Challenge. But then - in this context - the nonce created by the challenger \"bears recentness\" from the point of view of the Challenger, I would think. ",

I think that is typically way harder to agree on. A nonce in a Challenge/Response interaction does convey recentness, but due to the context of the protocol mechanism - not by the value itself.

              "body": "Okay :-) Let me rephrase that. A Challenger that intends to retrieve Evidence in a finite time, has a clock, and that intends to obtain a notion of recentness can track a time interval only using its clock to do this. The indicator for the duration here (duration being a time interval where the left time is an epoch starting with 0 at which the Challenge including a nonce is emitted and at the right time evidence including a digest of a nonce is received) is the time that has passed between Challenge and Response.\r\n\r\nVery small RESTful interactions as enabled via CoAP enable this (even with using an observe option) notion of recentness - intrinsically. Retaining state for an operation is not an implementation detail, I think. It is, for example required to associate CoAP tokens. Typically protocols use time-outs to avoid waiting until the end of the universe - and I think that is not an implementation detail, too, but an interaction model capability. The binding to what you call an transaction here, which typically is a operation I think, is what is the essential part to get a notion of recentness. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to your point, my point is that a re-use of a nonce that is cryptographically (and in this case uniquely) \"bound\" to a Response does not require synchronized clocks due to the \"recentness\" based on the uniqueness that is provided by the \"arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication\" (nonce) intrinsically.\r\n\r\nEdit: maybe this will also help us to converge here :-)\r\nRFC4949 definition of a nonce\r\nA random or non-repeating value that is included in data exchanged by a protocol, usually for the purpose of guaranteeing liveness and thus detecting and protecting gainst replay attacks.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, I think:\r\n\r\n1.) \"recentness by uniqueness\" is an over-simplification (you could receive two responses based on the same nonce, violating uniqueness wrt the nonce, and still only process the most recent response via sequence or clock use), and\r\n2.) \"recentness needs synchronized clocks between requestor and responder and is conveyed via a timestamp plus an expiration threshold associated with the provided evidence / attestation result.\" is not correct, due to being too specific (you do not always need synchronized clocks) and unnecessary limiting (you do not necessarily need time-stamps and or expiration dates).\r\n\r\nIf I would only look at the interaction model of TUDA, I would agree! :-) But looking at charra, tuda and subscribed evidence, I think I still cannot agree.\r\n\r\nEdit: I think I have to highlight that this is about the conveyance of evidence - only! As noted in another comment, a \"time of validity\" for, e.g. Attestation Results, is another matter of \"freshness\" that is not addressed in the current text. \r\n\r\n",

The section now states clearly that the overall goal is instead\r\nthe identification of the point in time when attestation claims have\r\nbeen signed and/or generated so that a freshness policy can be applied.\r\nIn this perspective, the fundamental property provided by a nonce-based\r\nscheme with regards to freshness is its ability to lock the requester's\r\nclock to the underlying protocol transaction, thus indirectly\r\nestablishing the epoch of the attestation / verification event.  By\r\nmaking the nonce unique and non-predictable, the timeline locking cannot\r\nbe subverted, which provides anti-replay.  However, that is a nice\r\nside-effect rather than the primary goal.\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds some precision around the nonce and clock\r\nproperties - unpredictability and trustworthiness respectively.",

In particular, by using \"solely\" I wanted to discuss the case where the only clock that the appraiser can trust is its own.  The intent of the [following text](https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture/pull/91/files#diff-29242c163e575f8093d7e76443c9d1d2R882-R883) is just to illustrate two common instances where the appraiser can't rely on the peer's clock.\r\n\r\nThe overall premise for this whole paragraph is that appraiser does _not_ consider any time assertion made the peer, and to determine what kind of information can be used in this case to evaluate freshness.\r\n\r\nClearly, once the peer's clock becomes usable - as in [this example](https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture/pull/91/files#diff-29242c163e575f8093d7e76443c9d1d2R897-R899) - then finer-grained timestamping can become input to the evaluation of the freshness policy as well.\r\n\r\nHopefully I have made my intention clear and the ambiguities in the existing text can be fixed accordingly :-)",

The notion of an external key vouching for the Attesting Environment's key is a key concept.   As you state, it's not the only input to the Verifier but that doesn't mean the term isn't an important concept to explain.",

              "body": "Things that are typically qualified are: origin of handle or intend of handle. E.g. if your handle is the hash of an external timestamp + local clock time + proof of synchronization of the two => you get TUDA. If your handle is the hash of a received nonce received during subscripton, a relative tick-counter originating from your Attesting Environment, and a reference to a global time-scale => you get Attestation Event Stream Subscription.\r\n\r\nIn general, qualifying data is used in the creation of evidence. It is a annotation of intend and context to a value. The new Restful Resources is showing a good subset in which very explicit rules enrich nonces so they become qualified data. The construction rules defined there provide a whole new spectrum of meanings/semantics to nonces (which TUDA also does, as does network device description, please see below). It is important to highlight that this \"semantic enrichment\" is allowed, actually used quite often in the field, and goes beyond what is typically perceived as the use of nonces (we also struggle with that until a few weeks ago, when there still was a very lob-sided focus on replay prevention in the freshness section). It is quite useful to dedicate at least one example in an Appendix to this topic, I think.\r\n\r\nPersonally, i thought \"qualifying data\" is a well known term, such as qualified name or such. So my ask is: is this a general misconception of mine? Think of it as nonces with a bigger scope semantics (which we call handles here). If qualifying data is really not self-explanatory, what would be a better phrasing?",

If seeing this as ascii art makes us not wanting to use three lines in the end but one, I am totally fine with that, personally.

Yet it is the vital point in time that drives this example (potentially no clocks involved, a lot of types of handles allowed). We wrote multiple text versions overtime until now and all resulted in a strange disconnect when you are very explicit about time(EG) and then suddenly you just use English text to express other points in time that are critical to secure remote attestation: \"and then the most important time is when the Attesting Environment becomes aware of changes to some relevant values in Target Environments, starts to collect them in order to create the semantic Claims and finally generates the Evidence at time(EG)\". There is a very confusing disconnect for the reader, why only the last time is expressed so explicitly, while the potential latency between VG and AA is the driver (or disabler!) for secure evidence here.\r\n\r\nWe are now maybe too reluctant to add more complexity and text right now. Maybe that is the primary cause for confusion, nowl. The security check you expect here is either an implementation specific one (is that okay to highlight here in the architecture?) or not conducted by the Attester but the Verifier or even at the Attestation Result appraisal stage at the Relying Party. That would create a lot of text to spell all that out. Maybe there is a simpler way to phrase it? When we read this in the editor's session, we should discuss this live.",

Effectively, that keeps them at the same point of time in low resolution timestamps and, analogously, not, if the resolution of timestamps is fine-grained enough. As we successful avoided to talk about timestamp resolution (which is essential to remote attestation, but not to this document), we'd like to keep it that way. Therefore, the choice if it is handle generation, handle emission, or handle reception is up to us here. I'd preferred distribution (encompassing the latency by referencing the start of distribution -> emission), but I can see how the perception is always falling back to \"local clocks\" even if they might not be there.\r\n\r\nSome high level context: in the end, this is for us to decide. Handle Distribution is used a lot in constraint node environments.\r\nSometimes things have clocks, sometimes they don't.\r\nSometimes you want to use a trustable central times authority, sometimes you don't.\r\nSometimes you can infer a time when values were generated, sometimes you can't.\r\nDepicting permutations of combinations of all existing factors would result in 32+ examples. So that did not seem reasonable.\r\n\r\nHence, example 4 is composite of the most typical constraints that you encounter in IoT:\r\n\r\n* sometimes no clocks\r\n* sometimes no central time\r\n* sometimes no capability for value monitoring\r\n\r\nMy personal goal is to capture these three essential items into example 4.

I very much agree that what you suggest is the best way and should be allowed for and encouraged in the architecture doc, but I also know that are many situations where it can't be done. For example, it can't be done with symmetric keys. It can't be done when you are putting keys into fuses on a chip that has no HW key generation feature. It can't be done when keys are supplied by someone other than the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSo it seems we need some term or wording to describe this that covers all the scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This PR mixes proposals for two issues, I think.\r\n\r\n1.) Moving (and reordering) the Terminology section is of course to be discussed. In comparison, it seems to me the smaller issue addressed. Please mind, that moving the terminology section to the top was an intentional action with the intent to improve readability. The ordering is more a question of style - and if semantic/hierarchic ordering helps, I am all for it.\r\n\r\nIf your activity of using this document during implementation revealed issues with the order of content sequence, that most definitely has to be taken under consideration.\r\n\r\n2.) Changing the layout of use cases as you proposed resonates well with my personal perception. Alas, adding well-defined terms here to help with the mapping to the terminology - therefore straying from the defining principle that use cases deliberately do not use any well-defined words, but colloquial language - was also a conscious decision. I am quite okay with your proposal, as it aligns with the principle of least surprised. But, I can also see the point that early mapping can help. Hence, this also has to be discussed.\r\n\r\nCould you please summarize both pieces of your proposal on rats@ietf.org and annotate them with your reasoning to start that discussion?",

It is however both imprecise (it should be the worst case delay among all receivers) and not really useful from an operational point of view.  Therefore I'm happy to remove it from the sentence which has clear enough prose to express the idea already.\r\n\r\nI think we also need to highlight that the extent of the overlap, the thing previously known as \"offset\" (would \"pad\" be a better name?), is a central protocol parameter which needs calibration and agreement among all the participants to be meaningful.  It's not a unilateral decision that a protocol participant makes up by itself.\r\n\r\nAnd another related thing (which I just realised, sorry for overloading the comment) is that the discussion seems to be assuming a network topology where V is _closer_ to the Handle Distributor than A - and therefore V\u2019s epoch starts _before_ A\u2019s epoch.  We should also consider the dual situation and therefore the case where Evidence arrives at V with a handle that V has not yet received.  This calls for extending the \u201coffset\u201d on the left to buffer _maybe valid_ handles?\r\n\r\n> [...] the original text inequalities are correct and this one is not\r\n\r\nOne of the troubles I was having with the original text is that I really don\u2019t understand what the inequality is supposed to say.  In particular, how is `time(HR_v)-time(EG_a)` a definition of \u201cage of the handle used\u201d?  Besides, it seems that there is an unstated assumption here that A and V have synchronised clocks - otherwise time(EG_a) and time(HR_v) are not on the same timeline and can't be meaningfully combined.\r\n",

Frankly, I care more about clarity at the conceptual level rather than anything else.  So, whatever device helps to better grasp the ideas is very welcome.\r\n\r\n> In general, Handle Distribution is in support of various scenarios. In some of them the receivers have no clocks at all, in some of them only a few - e.g. the Verifier. Maybe it would help with the scenario description, if we add a Clock to the Verfier? (so that only the swarm of Attesters has no clock)\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to say is just that the second inequality makes no sense because the two `time()` functions apply to different timelines (and are therefore the comparison is between pears and apples!) unless the underlying clocks at V and A are synchronised.  If we cannot assume the presence of clocks at nodes implementing the A role, let alone synchronised clocks, well that's another good reason for dropping the inequality, isn't it?\r\n\r\nIf instead there is at least some assumption on clock presence in some of the roles (and possibly a synchronisation requirement?), that should be clearly stated.\r\n",
